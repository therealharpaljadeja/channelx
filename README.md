Farcaster Channel Gating using DEGENx Superfluid Streams.

## Problem

Channel Passes that allow casting can be expensive, not everyone can afford them and not everyone wants to keep them forever.

## Solution

ChannelX allows a channel owner to gate casting on their channel using DEGENx SuperFluid streams, the user who wants to cast can start a DEGENx stream and after a certain threshold amount has been streamed the user will be allowed to cast in the channel!

## How it works

-   Sign in with Farcaster on the [app](https://channelx.vercel.app)
-   Select the channel you want to configure and set the DEGENx threshold after which the user will be allowed to cast.
-   Once done, add @bot007 as a co-host to your channel, that's it!
